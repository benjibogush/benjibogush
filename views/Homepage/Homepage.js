          This is Benji Bogush, 4.0 GPA in CS Software Engineering, achieving what no one has ever done. Specialize in test automation and app development, my goal is to become full stack developer and automation specialist for both software and hardware. I'm a tough coder who disconnect entirely from the world true to the tone. Not to brag about my skill, but to emphasize how much value I bring to the companies I work for. I take ownerwhip and add more quality and value to the product being developed.
